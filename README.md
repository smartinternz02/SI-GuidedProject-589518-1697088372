Predicting Mental Health Illness Of Working Professionals Using Machine Learning

Project Description:

Mental Health First Aid teaches participants how to notice and support an individual who may be experiencing a mental health or substance use concern or crisis and connect them with the appropriate employee resources.

Employers can offer robust benefits packages to support employees who go through mental health issues. That includes Employee Assistance Programs, Wellness programs that focus on mental and physical health, Health and Disability Insurance, or flexible working schedules or time off policies. Organizations that incorporate mental health awareness help to create a healthy and productive work environment that reduces the stigma associated with mental illness, increases the organizations' mental health literacy, and teaches the skills to safely and responsibly respond to a co-worker's mental health concern.

The main purpose of the Mental Health Prediction system is to predict whether a person needs to seek Mental health treatment or not based on inputs provided by them.

We will be using classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, GradientBoost, and XGBoost. We will train and test the data with these algorithms. From this, the best model is selected and saved in pkl format. We will also be deploying our model locally using Flask.
